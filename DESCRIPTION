Description: alfa (Alignment-free analysis) 
    will be an R package for carrying out comparative genomic analysis using
    alignment-free methods. The tool will rely on k-mer based methods and
    different metrics to compute the similarity/dissimilarity given a set of
    sequences. The result can then be plotted as a heatmap or used to construct
    phylogenetic trees.
